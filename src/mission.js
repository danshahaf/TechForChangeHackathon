        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>WeVote is a community of volunteers who seek to improve political representation and accountability by increasing voter turnout in underrepresented communities. In order to correct structural, systemic, and institutional inequalities, we must have representatives who fight to represent all people, with a focus on historically marginalized groups: low-income communities, youth and senior citizens, communities of colors, and people with disabilities. We hope to facilitate the process of voting, voter literacy and turnout so that voters are both inspired and empowered with the knowledge to elect those who best represent their interests.
